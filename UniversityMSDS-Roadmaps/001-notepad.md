# Rough Notes

## Planning Day | September 01, 2019 | Sunday

I have cloned Hamza's repo. Now I have to load my stuff in my local repo, and add to his repo too. As a prerequisite, I must PLAN. Without planning everything might snap in the midway. I have taken many courses and gone through a lot of material in my learning jounry. Some of the awesome resources I have available are:

- Datacamp
- Coursera
- LinkedIn Learning
- CognitiveAI
- O'Reilly Books

It's just great to have these resources. I am going to make a roadmap for MSDS. Speaking in broad terms, I have to accomplish following goals:

- Learn Basic Machine Learning Concepts and Terminology
- Learn and implement all popular ML models
- Learn the basics of Deep Learning
- Learn and Implement different DL models, e.g., Autoencoders
- Learn basics of statistical analysis
- Learn Data Visualization
- Learn different types of data,data extraction from various data sources (Data Extration, Manipulation, Preprocessing)


Tools include:
- Python
    - Scikit-Learn
    - TensorFlow
    - Keras
    - statsmodels
    - PyTorch
    - Seaborn
